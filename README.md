I implemented a UART module using Verilog and deployed it on an FPGA kit. The project involved designing the transmitter and receiver, simulating their functionality, and successfully testing data transmission and reception between the FPGA and a computer. This hands-on experience enhanced my skills in digital design and hardware-software integration.
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a hardware communication protocol that facilitates serial communication between devices. Unlike synchronous protocols, UART does not require a shared clock signal. Instead, it transmits data by encoding it in a series of bits with a start bit, data bits, an optional parity bit, and stop bits. UART is widely used in embedded systems for communication between microcontrollers, computers, and peripheral devices due to its simplicity and reliability.
